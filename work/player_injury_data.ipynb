    "# Scraping Player Injury Data\n",
    "I scraped all player injury data from TSN.ca's player profiles. In order to find the URLs for each player profile I first scraped the main TSN player page for links to every available profile. I then iterated through each profile to scrape the section containing injury, transaction, and suspension data. I finally converted the list of profile data into a DataFrame, removed non-injury events, and parsed reports for length and type of injury. I utilized Selenium for scraping because both the TSN player menu and profile pages use Javascript to populate their table data."
